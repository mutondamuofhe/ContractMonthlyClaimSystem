 Updated Lecturer Feedback – Focus on Part 3

In this updated version of my project, I focused on implementing the automation and system improvements required for Part 3. I built on the foundation created in Part 2 and enhanced the system to align with the assessment requirements and industry standards.

🔹 Automation Rules (Part 3)

I implemented a ClaimProcessor service to automatically handle incoming claims based on business rules:

Condition	            / System 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
No documents uploaded	/ Claim remains Pending – Needs Documents
Amount under threshold	/ Auto-Approved by the system
Amount too high	        / Escalated to Academic Manager

This helps reduce manual work and improves turnaround times.

🔹 Coordinator / Academic Manager Dashboard

The dashboard was updated to visually reflect the automation process, allowing users to:

View Pending & Escalated claims

See who processed the claim and when

Trigger Auto Check manually using a button

Approve / Reject with confirmation modals and reason input

This improved usability and made the verification workflow more efficient.

🔹 HR Automation – CSV Export

I created a dedicated HR module that includes:

An Export page with date filters

CSV file generation of all approved claims

Secure download with all required fields for payroll

This fulfills the requirement for invoice/report generation for finance processing.

🔹 Unit Testing with xUnit + EF InMemory

To ensure reliability and quality:

I added unit tests for automation rules

Used EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory to simulate database interactions

Tested Auto-Approval, Escalation, and Needs-Docs logic successfully

This improves system stability and proves correct implementation of business logic.

🔹 Overall Impact

Part 3 transformed the system from a simple claim submission app into a semi-automated claims processing platform with:
 Role-based access control
 Smart automation logic
 HR report generation
 Error handling and validation
 Unit testing for reliability

 Conclusion

The system is now well-aligned with real-world industry use cases and meets all requirements for Part 3 of the POE. With clear role separation, automation logic, and test coverage, the system is ready for further deployment or extension.
